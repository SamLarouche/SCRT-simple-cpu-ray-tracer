# SCRT- (Very) Simple CPU Ray Tracer

My code as I follow **Pete Shirley**'s book series "Ray Tracing in...". For now it's still very WIP. The first step here is to implement a rudimentary form of raytracing for primitive 3d objects (spheres, rectangles, etc).

The goal is to make code that is more expandable than the examples in the books. Enventually, I want to use to code to make a kind of mock rendering software (which would read simple 3d objects from .obj files and render them).
